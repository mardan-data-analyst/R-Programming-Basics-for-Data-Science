Markup Language and it is used mainly for writing web pages.\n\nAn HTML page consists of many organized HTML nodes or elements that tell a browser how to render its content.\n\nEach node or element has a start tag and an end tag with the same name and wraps some textual content.\n\nOne key feature of HTML is that nodes can be nested within other nodes, organizing into a tree-like structure like the folders in a file system. Below is a basic HTML node structure:\n\n* `<html>` node is the root node,\n* `<html>` node has two children: `<head>` and `<body>`.\n* Since the `<head>` and `<body>` nodes have the same parent `<html>` node they are siblings to each other.\n* Similarly, the `<body>` node has two child nodes, the `<h1>` and `<p>` nodes.\n\nIt is important to understand this tree-structure when writing a new HTML page or extracting data from an existing HTML page.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The `rvest` library\n\nThe `rvest` package is a popular web scraping package for R.
